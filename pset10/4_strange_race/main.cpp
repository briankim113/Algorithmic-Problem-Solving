/*
This is not a graph problem (nor is it DP). 

rearrange the cubes as fast as possible such that the numbers on the cubes appear in increasing order from left to right
only allowed action is to swap the position of two consecutive cubes
what is the minimum number of moves required?

N, number of cubes, 1 <= N <= 10000000
Each of N lines has one integer x, 1 <= x <= 1,000,000,000
GUARANTEED no duplicate cube numbers

Sounds like a bubble sort - just count the number of steps?
Time out on 27~32 - O(n^2) is not good enough?
NOT bubble sort - confirmed in class
Merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, count the number of steps?
